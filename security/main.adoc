== Background

The Norwegian banks are in the process of implementing ISO 20022-based messages for handling of payments, such as payment instructions from customers or notifications sent to customers. This development implies an introduction of ISO 20022-based messages in the bank-customer interface and a gradual phase-out of the currently established formats. As part of this implementation there have also been a growing recognition for improvements to the communication infrastructures used. It is recognized that any future communication infrastructure used in the bank-customer interface need to build upon infrastructures and standards commonly accepted in the market and provide the technical and legal security required for this type of business transactions.

The PEPPOL eDelivery network is widely used for exchange of invoices and credit notes in EHF and PEPPOL BIS formats in the Norwegian market. It is also used for exchange of product catalogues and orders in the same formats. A clear majority of the public sector, most banks and more than 65.000 private sector entities can receive documents through the network, and in 2016 more than 35 million invoices was exchanged. More than 50 service providers offer connectivity to the PEPPOL eDelivery network through access points, and more than 60 service providers offer solutions to issue or receive EHF or PEPPOL BIS business documents. From 2017, an enhanced version of the PEPPOL eDelivery network will be used for submission of tenders in public procurement.

Both banks and ERP vendors, as well as their customers, have a need for one common solution for transport of ISO 20022-based messages. By using a common eDelivery solution for handling ISO 20022-based messages banks, ERP vendors and their customers need only to connect to the infrastructure once to serve the entire market.

This document sets out the Bits’ security requirements all parties using any transport infrastructure will have to adhere to, in order to be allowed access to the network for transfer of payment information.

Initially the infrastructure used is Enhanced PEPPOL. Therefore, Enhanced PEPPOL is referred to throughout.

This document will have to be revised annually or if there are major changes, such as the document being applied to a different transport infrastructure.

[appendix]
== Storage of private keys

Security best practices for corporate environments with large transactions, and transaction volume where the private key must be protected by the strictest means:

It is industry best practice, and the most secure approach, to maintain private keys in a physical Hardware Security Module (HSM). The private key should be created and stored only inside the HSM. This prevents, with the strictest means, the private key so that it is not compromised or copied by an attacker.

This also requires the application to address the private key with an interface, e.g. PKCS#11, since it does not have direct access to the private key to perform cryptographic operations.

For development and test environments, and environments where a physical HSM is not feasible, a virtual HSM should be considered.

Using HSM would in a large amount have mitigated the Heartbleed attack, since the attacker could not extract the private key from memory, because the private key is NOT residing in memory of the server.

The use of HSM should be considered both for protection data in transit (web server) and data at rest cryptographic functions (singing, non-repudiation etc.)
